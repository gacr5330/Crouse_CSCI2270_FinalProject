# Crouse_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:

This program is an rpg game where the user creates a character with their name and chooses their character class, in this case, "fighter" or "rogue". The character starts in the guild hall, and the program is able to make as many other areas to explore that the programer feels like creating. I only created one other room to show the concept of the program. At each room, you will be asked with you want to 1.) go to character settings 2.)go to other room or 3.) search the area. The character settings allows you to view your inventory, player stats, and equip armour and weapons. Note* until you search the areas, you will not have any items or equipment to equip. You will also battle a weak monster that will change your stats. 

How to Run:

To run this program, start by unzipping the project file you downloaded. Inside contains the main.cpp function with the header files "inventory.hpp","creature.hpp","item.hpp","atlas.hpp","armour.hpp","dialogue.hpp","weapon.hpp","area.hpp", and "battle.hpp". No resource files are needed for this program because the "atlas.hpp" header contains all premade information. The project was compiled using a CodeBlocks project file . However, you can compile the code with most other programs if you manually add the files or copy and paste the code.

System Requirements :

This program was built on Linux using CodeBlocks, but is designed to work on any compiler on any system.

Open Issues/bugs:

The program is in its elementary form so it does not contain much play-time material, and the program does not have an option to close if you get bored of the game, so you have to manually exit out of the code.
